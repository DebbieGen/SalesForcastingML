# Overview
In sales_forcasting_ml, the goal is to use Machine Learning to forecast future product sales with 5 years worth of limited product sales data. Since the dataset is limited, we are using Pandas, Upgini, and Catboost to demonstate how it could assist with the prediction.

## File

* train.csv.zip
  * 5 years of product sales dataset in csv

## Installation

* Python
* Pandas
  * open source data analysis and manipulation tool
* Upgini
  * an intelligent data search engine with a python library that automatically finds only relevant features to improve performance of ML model
* Catboost
  * open source software library that provides a gradient boosting framework which among other features attempts to solve for Categorical features using a permutation driven alternative compared to the classical algorithm
